TO DO:

* Allow input scaling to evolve within genome.
* UpdateCellParameters now contains the updating and output of the gene network. Still needs to incorporate divisions.
* Change the events at end of season. No more clustered divisions, only death.
* Add mutation of the genome upon cell division (In MutateCells?)
* Assign new timing of network updating upon division (gextiming) and upon fresh creation of cells
* Get the gradient concentration that each cell perceives into their grad_conc par (in CellsEat2)
* add divtime and divdur parameters to parameter module
