TO DO:

V Allow input scaling to evolve within genome.
V UpdateCellParameters now contains the updating and output of the gene network. Still needs to incorporate divisions.
V Change the events at end of season. No more clustered divisions, only death.
V Add mutation of the genome upon cell division (In MutateCells?)
V Assign new timing of network updating upon division (gextiming) and upon fresh creation of cells
V Get the gradient concentration that each cell perceives into their grad_conc par (in CellsEat2)
V add divtime and divdur parameters to parameter module
V Add mindeathprob and fitscale to parameters
V Color cells with a particular state differently...
